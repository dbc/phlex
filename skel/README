Python C extensions require that 
#include <Python.h>
occur in the source prior to any system includes. 
The simplest way to accomplish that in flex is to
patch the flex.skl skeleton file.  The skeleton 
here is a copy of the flex.skl file in the sources
for flex version 2.5.35, with a simple one line
patch that inserts the #include in a convenient
location.

To use this skeleton in your build, copy it to
a convenient location and use the --skel option 
to override flex's built-in skeleton.
